\f0\fs24 \cf0 The \'93PROTEINS.pt\'94 dataset contains 1,113 three-mode tensors in size 2*50*50, converted from the original \'93PROTEINS\'94 dataset (https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/proteins) that consists of 1,113 protein graphs labeled according to whether they are enzymes. Each graph represents the structure of a single protein, where the vertices represent the secondary structure elements (i.e., the helices, sheets, and turns) of the protein, and the edges connect nodes that are neighbors along the amino acid sequence or neighbors in space within the protein structure. We employ Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to encode the topological and structural features of each graph into a three-mode tensor of dimensions 2*50*50. The tensor consists of two 50\'d750 persistence images, each generated by a different filtration function. These filtration functions reveal specific topological structures at different levels of connectivity, such\
as the number of relations of a node (i.e., degree centrality score), node flow information (i.e., betweenness centrality score), information spread capability (i.e., closeness centrality score), and other node centrality measurements. With each filtration function, a persistence image of resolution 50*50 is constructed using tools in persistent homology analysis. Please refer to https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12007 for details on the implementation of TDA.\

The \'93PTC_FM_50.pt\'94 dataset contains 349 three-mode tensors in size 5*50*50, converted from the original \'93PTC_FM\'94 dataset (https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/ptc) 5*50*50 that contains 349 compound graphs classified according to the carcinogenicity on female mice. In each graph, the vertices represent atoms, and the edges represent chemical bonds.  Similar to the PROTEINS dataset, we employ Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to encode the topological and structural features of each graph into a three-mode tensor of dimensions 5*50*50, composed of 50*50 persistence diagrams from five filtration functions. More information on the original datasets can be found at https://chrsmrrs.github.io/datasets/docs/datasets/ and in the references therein.\

The files \'93proteins.ipynb\'94 and \'93PTC_FM_50.ipynb\'94 provide code for reproducing the data analysis results in the manuscript \'93Distributed Tensor Principal Component Analysis with Data Heterogeneity,\'94 including the necessary code for loading the dataset into Python and downloading the labels.}
